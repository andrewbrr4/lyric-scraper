ground control to major tom
ground control to major tom
take your protein pills and put your helmet on
(ten) ground control (nine) to major tom (eight, seven)
(six) commencing (five) countdown, engines on
(four, three, two)
check ignition (one) and may god's love (lift off) be with you



this is ground control to major tom
you've really made the grade
and the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
this is major tom to ground control
i'm stepping through the door
and i'm floating in a most peculiar way
and the stars look very different today

for here am i sitting in my tin can
far above the world
planet earth is blue
and there's nothing i can do




though i'm past one hundred thousand miles
i'm feeling very still
and i think my spaceship knows which way to go
tell my wife i love her very much
she knows
ground control to major tom
your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
can you hear me, major tom?
can you hear me, major tom?
can you hear me, major tom?
can you-


-here am i floating 'round my tin can
far above the moon
planet earth is blue
and there's nothing i can do


“heroes” 
i, i will be king
and you, you will be queen
though nothing will drive them away
we can beat them just for one day
we can be heroes just for one day


and you, you can be mean
and i, i'll drink all the time
'cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
yes, we're lovers, and that is that


though nothing will keep us together
we could steal time just for one day
we can be heroes forever and ever
what d'you say?

i, i wish you could swim
like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim


though nothing, nothing will keep us together
we can beat them forever and ever
oh, we can be heroes just for one day


i, i will be king
and you, you will be queen
though nothing will drive them away
we can be heroes, just for one day
we can be us just for one day

i, i can remember (i remember)
standing by the wall (by the wall)
and the guns shot above our heads (over our heads)
and we kissed as though nothing could fall (nothing could fall)


and the shame was on the other side
oh, we can beat them forever and ever
then we could be heroes just for one day

we can be heroes
we can be heroes
we can be heroes just for one day
we can be heroes


we're nothing, and nothing will help us
maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
but we could be safer just for one day
oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, just for one day

★ (blackstar) 
in the villa of ormen, in the villa of ormen
stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
in the centre of it all, in the centre of it all
your eyes
on the day of execution, on the day of execution
only women kneel and smile, ah-ah, ah-ah
at the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
your eyes, your eyes
​

ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah
in the villa of ormen, in the villa of ormen
stands a solitary candle, ah-ah, ah-ah
at the centre of it all, at the centre of it all
your eyes, your eyes
ah-ah-ah

something happened on the day he died
spirit rose a metre and stepped aside
somebody else took his place, and bravely cried
(i'm a blackstar, i'm a blackstar)
how many times does an angel fall?
how many people lie instead of talking tall?
he trod on sacred ground, he cried loud into the crowd
(i'm a blackstar, i'm a blackstar, i'm not a gangstar)
​
i can't answer why (i'm a blackstar)
just go with me (i'm not a filmstar)
i'ma take you home (i'm a blackstar)
take your passport and shoes (i'm not a popstar)
and your sedatives, boo (i'm a blackstar)
you're a flash in the pan (i'm not a marvel star)
i'm the great i am (i'm a blackstar)
​
i'm a blackstar, way up, on money, i've got game
i see right, so wide, so open-hearted pain
i want eagles in my daydreams, diamonds in my eyes
(i'm a blackstar, i'm a blackstar)
something happened on the day he died

(i'm a blackstar, i'm a star's star, i'm a blackstar)
i can't answer why (i'm not a gangstar)
but i can tell you how (i'm not a flam star)
we were born upside-down (i'm a star's star)
born the wrong way 'round (i’m not a white star)
i'm a blackstar, i'm not a gangstar
i'm a blackstar, i'm a blackstar
i'm not a pornstar, i'm not a wandering star
i'm a blackstar, i’m a blackstar

starman 
hey now, now
oh, oh, oh


didn't know what time it was, the lights were low
i leaned back on my radio
some cat was layin down some rock 'n' roll
"lotta soul," he said
then the loud sound did seem to fade
came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
that weren't no dj, that was hazy cosmic jive


there's a starman waiting in the sky
he'd like to come and meet us
but he thinks he'd blow our minds
there's a starman waiting in the sky
he's told us not to blow it
'cause he knows it's all worthwhile
he told me
let the children lose it
let the children use it
let all the children boogie

i had to phone someone so i picked on you
hey, that's far out, so you heard him too
switch on the tv, we may pick him up on channel two
look out your window, i can see his light
if we can sparkle he may land tonight
don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright
